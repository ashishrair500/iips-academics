# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- This platform is created for our college , offering easy
access to essential study materials. It includes subject
syllabus , lecture notes , online references and previ-
ous year papers , providing a convenient and enriched
learning experience for students.

• Language Used –JavaScript (for both frontend and
backend).

• Front End – React framework for building the user
interface. CSS for styling.

• Back End – Redux for state management on the client-
